YT Workshop

YTW starts as a lightweight video annotation software in HTML5. 

Video annotation software is used in Sign Language linguistics to annotate SL videos. 
It can also be used to analyse other kinds of videos like videos of dance.

There are reference software for SL annotation : AnColin, Anvil, ELAN, ILex, SignStream, etc. 


As Youtube is a great source of videos, I want YTW able to work with it. 
It is possible through Youtube's IFrame API.
